## FrontendStatus type

Represents whether an address has been registered as a Liquity frontend.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type FrontendStatus = {
    status: "unregistered";
} | {
    status: "registered";
    kickbackRate: Decimal;
};
```
<b>References:</b> [Decimal](./arth-lib-base.decimal.md)

## Remarks

Returned by the [getFrontendStatus()](./arth-lib-base.readableliquity.getfrontendstatus.md) function.

When `status` is `"registered"`<!-- -->, `kickbackRate` gives the frontend's kickback rate as a [Decimal](./arth-lib-base.decimal.md) between 0 and 1.
